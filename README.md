# Web Scraping

Website: zoopla.co.uk, a website that displays flats and houses for rent or sale.<br >

The information such as address, price and quantity of bedrooms was collected from 400 pages provided on the website, using web scrapping with a package BeautifulSoup.

The data was then exported to an excel sheet.
